# When Creativity Kills Usability

CreativeAgencyXYZ wanted to showcase their creative prowess. Instead, they've created a website that's more tech demo than business tool. The site is so focused on showing what they *can* do, they forgot to show what they *actually* do.

## The Parallax Problem

37 different parallax scrolling sections. That's not a typo. Each section moves at a different speed, creating a nauseating experience that makes finding information impossible. 

The effects include:
- Background images moving at 0.5x speed
- Foreground elements at 1.5x speed
- Text sliding in from random directions
- Floating 3D objects that follow your cursor
- Particle effects that obscure content

## The Hidden Menu

The navigation menu is a masterpiece of user hostility. It only appears after hovering over an invisible hotspot in the top-left corner for exactly 10 seconds. Move your mouse too soon? Timer resets. Too late? It disappears.

## Finding Contact Information

The contact information is literally hidden in HTML comments:

```html
<!-- 
  If you're reading this, you're probably desperate to contact us.
  Email: hello@creativeagencyxyz.com
  Phone: We don't do phone calls, we're creative.
-->
```

## Animation Overload

Every single interaction triggers a full-page animation:
- Click a link: 3-second page transition with spinning logos
- Hover over text: Words scatter and reassemble
- Scroll down: Entire sections flip and rotate
- Try to leave: Exit-intent popup with 5-second animation

## Performance Impact

- Page weight: 127MB (mostly animation libraries)
- Load time: 23 seconds on fiber internet
- CPU usage: 100% while idle
- Mobile experience: Phone gets hot, battery drains

## What They Actually Do

After 20 minutes of exploration, I still don't know:
- What services they offer
- Who their clients are
- How much they charge
- Where they're located

## The Solution

1. **Static header with visible navigation**
2. **Limit parallax to 1-2 subtle effects**
3. **Clear service descriptions on homepage**
4. **Visible contact information**
5. **Performance budget: 3MB max, 3-second load time**

Sometimes the most creative solution is simplicity.

**Estimated fix time**: 2 weeks (complete rebuild recommended)  
**Priority**: High - site actively repels potential clients
