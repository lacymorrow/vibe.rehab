# The Checkout Nightmare

BuyStuffOnline has managed to turn the simple act of purchasing into an endurance test. Their checkout process is so complex, it makes filing taxes look straightforward.

## The 7-Step Journey

Most e-commerce sites use a 2-3 step checkout. BuyStuffOnline has somehow stretched this to 7 steps:

1. **Cart Review** - Standard
2. **Account Creation** - Requires email verification
3. **Shipping Address** - No address validation
4. **Billing Address** - Can't use same as shipping
5. **Shipping Method** - This is where costs appear
6. **Payment Method** - Multiple failed attempts
7. **Order Confirmation** - Finally!

## The Password Problem

The password requirements are absurd:
- Minimum 47 characters
- At least 3 emojis
- No dictionary words
- Must include a mathematical equation
- Cannot contain your name, email, or birthday

## Cart Expiration

The shopping cart expires every 30 seconds. Users lose their items mid-checkout and have to start over. This "security feature" is actually costing them sales.

## Hidden Costs

Shipping costs only appear at step 6. A $20 item becomes $45 with shipping and handling fees. No wonder the cart abandonment rate is 94%.

## The Impact

- **94% cart abandonment rate**
- **Average 12 minutes to complete purchase**
- **67% of users give up at password creation**
- **Customer support overwhelmed with checkout issues**

## The Solution

Simplify everything. Use a standard 2-step checkout, reasonable password requirements, and show all costs upfront. This isn't rocket science - it's basic e-commerce.
