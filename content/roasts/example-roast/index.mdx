# The Digital Disaster That Broke the Internet

When I first visited this website, I thought my browser had crashed. Then I realized it was just the site's "design." What we have here is a masterclass in how NOT to build a website in 2024.

## The Homepage Horror

*Yes, this is real. No, this is not a joke.*

The first thing that hits you isn't the content—it's the assault on your retinas. The designer apparently thought, "What if we made a website that looks like a unicorn exploded in a rainbow factory?"

<Issue type="error">
The color scheme uses 47 different colors, including "Neon Vomit Green" (#39FF14) and "Migraine Magenta" (#FF1493). Color theory died for this.
</Issue>

## Navigation Nightmare

The navigation menu is a work of art—if that art is meant to confuse and frustrate users. Here's what we're dealing with:

![Navigation menu disaster](navigation-menu.png)

- **Home** leads to a 404 page
- **About** opens a PDF that downloads automatically
- **Services** triggers a JavaScript alert that says "Under Construction Since 1999"
- **Contact** plays a MIDI file of "Never Gonna Give You Up"

<Solution>
Create a simple, consistent navigation structure. Use semantic HTML and make sure every link actually works. Revolutionary concept, I know.
</Solution>

## The Typography Tragedy

The font choices here are... bold. By bold, I mean they chose Comic Sans for the headers, Wingdings for the body text, and what appears to be a custom font called "Illegible Script" for the footer.

<Rating score={1}>
Accessibility nightmare. Screen readers weep.
</Rating>

## Performance Apocalypse

This website loads slower than dial-up internet. Here's why:

1. **Images**: 47 unoptimized images, including a 15MB GIF of a dancing hamster
2. **Scripts**: 23 different JavaScript libraries, including jQuery 1.2.6 and three different carousel plugins
3. **CSS**: 12 stylesheets, some of which override each other completely

The lighthouse score is so low, it's basically underground.

## Mobile Experience: A War Crime

On mobile, this site commits crimes against humanity:

![Mobile view comparison](mobile-disaster.png)

- Text is smaller than ant handwriting
- Buttons are impossible to tap
- Horizontal scrolling is required for everything
- The site crashes on phones older than 2023

<Issue type="warning">
The mobile version is just the desktop version squeezed into a smaller box. Responsive design is apparently a foreign concept.
</Issue>

## The Silver Lining

There isn't one. This website is a cautionary tale of what happens when you let your nephew "who's good with computers" design your business website.

<Solution>
Start over. Seriously. Delete everything and begin with a blank HTML file. It will be an improvement.
</Solution>

## Final Verdict

This website achieves something remarkable: it makes MySpace profiles from 2003 look professionally designed. It's a digital museum of every bad web design trend from the past 25 years, all crammed into one horrifying experience.

**The Good:** It loads eventually (after 45 seconds)
**The Bad:** Everything else
**The Ugly:** The color scheme, typography, layout, functionality, and general existence

If you're looking for inspiration on how NOT to build a website, bookmark this masterpiece. It's educational in the same way that watching someone stick a fork in an electrical outlet is educational.
