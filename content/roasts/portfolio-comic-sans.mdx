# The 1999 Time Capsule

This developer portfolio is like stepping into a time machine - if that time machine was broken and took you to the worst parts of the early web.

## Typography Disaster

The entire site uses Comic Sans. Not as a joke, not ironically, but as the primary font for a professional developer portfolio. The body text, headings, code samples - everything is in Comic Sans.

## The Audio Assault

The site auto-plays a MIDI version of "Sandstorm" on page load. There's no way to stop it except closing the tab. The audio quality sounds like it's coming from a 1990s answering machine.

## Visual Chaos

The background is an animated GIF of rotating gears that never stops. Combined with the blinking text and scrolling marquee, it's genuinely difficult to read any content.

## Contact Information

Instead of using actual text or a contact form, the contact information is a screenshot of an email address. Users can't copy-paste it, and it's barely readable due to the compression.

## The Skills Section

The skills are listed as animated bouncing text:
- "HTML (I know ALL the tags!)"
- "CSS (I can make things rainbow!)"
- "JavaScript (I copied code from Stack Overflow!)"

## Code Samples

The code samples are screenshots of code, not actual code blocks. They're also written in Comic Sans and contain syntax errors.

## The Visitor Counter

There's a visitor counter at the bottom showing "You are visitor #00042" - clearly reset recently and counting every page refresh.

## The Fix

This portfolio needs a complete redesign focusing on:
- Professional typography
- Clean, readable layout
- Proper code presentation
- Accessible contact information
- Modern web standards

**Estimated fix time**: 1 week  
**Priority**: High - actively damaging professional reputation
