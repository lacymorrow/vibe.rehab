# Rahul Rajput Developer Portfolio

Honestly, Rahul didn't make this easy. I really like all of his work, and it's obvious he's a skilled developer, so I'm going to be a little more critical.

The first site is Rahul's personal developer portfolio, almost like a online resume. To begin I take a look at the site header and run a lighthouse benchmark.
